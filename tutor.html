                <p class="txt">In ALIAS you have to say things in “other words”. The idea is to explain words using synonyms,
                    opposites or clues so that your team mates guess as many words from the card as possible before the
                    sand in the sand timer runs out. The team moves forward on the board the same amount as words
                    guessed. The team to reach the ‘Finish’ first is the winner. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="rules__explaining">
                <p class="txt">When explaining, you cannot use any part of the word on the card, nor a derivative of it.
                    For example, you cannot explain the word “handbag” by saying “a small bag women usually carry”,
                    or the word “balloon” by saying “a ball filled with air” since balloon and ball are derived from the
                    same word. You could, however, say “a colourful object filled with air”.
                    If the word has two parts, for example “tape recorder”, and someone guesses “tape player”, you can
                    then use the first part and help your team by saying “the tape is right but use another word for
                    player”. </p>
